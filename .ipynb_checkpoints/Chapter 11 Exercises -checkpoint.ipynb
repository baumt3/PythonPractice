    "## 1) Question one asks me to write an Employee class that keeps data attributes for Employee Name and Employee Number. The to write a class name ProductionWorker that is a subclass of the Employee class. the ProductionWorker class should keep data attributes for Shift Number (an integer, such as 1, 2, or 3) and Hourly Pay Rate. Once the class codes have been written I will need to write a program that creates an object of the ProductionWorker class and prompts the user to enter data for each of the object's data attributes. It will then need to store that data in the object, then use the object's accessor methods to retrieve it and display it on the screen."
